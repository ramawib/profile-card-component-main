## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (variables and mixins)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge, I learned not to underestimate things. I decided to start this challenge as it looks easy enough and said to myself that I can finish this in just 10 minutes. Turns out, it's not as easy as it looks and so this challenge manages to humble myself down. Moreover, now I can see why most developer overestimates their delivery time.

Nonetheless, I learned how to use flex and grid layout on the SCSS. This is the second challenge that I finished from Frontend Mentor. It may not looks as identical as the design especially in the card width and height (since I don't have the Figma file), but I'm happy with the end result ðŸ˜Š.

### Continued development

I've put a row-gap and flex-wrap properties in the #wrapper if someone would like to add multiple card in one page. It can fit up to 8 card (2 rows, 4 columns) on desktop view.

As for mobile view, I haven't code the proper layout for multiple card case (the background isn't expanding and there are still no gap between card).

Nonetheless, the main objective in this challenge has been completed. I may or may not develop the mobile-multiple-card case in the future (maybe I will if it's needed ðŸ˜´).
